1. Project Setup
Create a new Java project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).
Define a proper package structure (e.g., com.example.db).


ðŸ”¹ 2. Add JDBC Dependency
If using Maven, add MySQL JDBC dependency in pom.xml.
If not using Maven, download the MySQL JDBC .jar and add it to the projectâ€™s build path.


ðŸ”¹ 3. Create Enum Singleton Class
Define an enum with a single instance (INSTANCE).
In the constructor, initialize the database connection using DriverManager.


ðŸ”¹ 4. Create DAO Class
Create a class (e.g., UserDAO) that uses the singleton instance to perform DB operations.
Use the getConnection() method from the singleton enum.


ðŸ”¹ 5. Create Main Class for Testing
Create a Main class to:
Call DAO methods.
Verify if only one DB connection instance is used.


ðŸ”¹ 6. Create Database and Table in MySQL
Open MySQL client or GUI tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
Create a database (e.g., testdb).
Create a table (e.g., users) with sample columns.


ðŸ”¹ 7. Run the Application
Execute the Main class.
Observe console output to ensure:
Connection is established once.
Operations (like insert) are successful.
Singleton instance is reused.


ðŸ”¹ 8. Optional: Test in Multiple Classes
Use the singleton in other classes/services to confirm the same connection object is used everywhere.


ðŸ”¹ 9. Validate with HashCode (Optional)
Print the hashcode of connection objects in different classes to verify singleton behavior.


ðŸ”¹ 10. Exception Handling
Add try-catch for SQL exceptions and print meaningful error messages.
Ensure resources (statements, result sets) are closed properly.
