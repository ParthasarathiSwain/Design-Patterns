# 🎯 Java Design Patterns – Hands-On Practice Repository

Welcome to the **Java Design Patterns Practice Repository**, where you'll explore clean and real-world implementations of all **23 Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns**.

This repository is designed to help you:

* 👨‍💻 Understand the core design patterns.
* 📦 Apply them to real-world Java projects.
* 🎓 Ace interviews and build scalable systems.

## 📘 Design Pattern Categories

This project is organized into 3 main categories:

### 🏗️ Creational Patterns

> Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

* **Singleton** – Only one instance of a class. → [Singleton Complete Guide](./Creational/Singleton/singleton_design_pattern_complete_guide.md)
* **Factory Method** – Create objects without specifying the exact class.
* **Abstract Factory** – Create families of related objects without specifying their classes.
* **Builder** – Construct complex objects step by step.
* **Prototype** – Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones.

### 🧱 Structural Patterns

> Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

* **Adapter** – Bridge between incompatible interfaces.
* **Bridge** – Separate abstraction from implementation.
* **Composite** – Tree-like structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **Decorator** – Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
* **Facade** – Simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **Flyweight** – Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.
* **Proxy** – Represent another object with a surrogate.

### 🔁 Behavioral Patterns

> Patterns that are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

* **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass request along a chain of handlers.
* **Command** – Encapsulate a request as an object.
* **Interpreter** – Define a language grammar and interpreter.
* **Iterator** – Sequential access to elements.
* **Mediator** – Reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
* **Memento** – Capture and restore an object's state.
* **Observer** – Notify dependent objects of state changes.
* **State** – Allow an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.
* **Strategy** – Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
* **Template Method** – Define the program skeleton and defer steps to subclasses.
* **Visitor** – Separate algorithms from objects on which they operate.

Each folder contains:

* ✅ Java code
* 🧠 Simple explanation
* 🧪 Test or usage example
* 📚 (Optional) UML Diagrams (coming soon)

## ▶️ How to Run

Each design pattern has its own `Test` class or `Main` method. You can compile and run them using:

```bash
javac pattern_folder/PatternExample.java
java pattern_folder.PatternExample
```

Or use your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode) to run the classes directly.
